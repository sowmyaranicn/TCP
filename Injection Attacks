4 attacks
2-----> Learning sequence numbers 
2-----> Learning port numbers
Global IP-ID counter
Exploiting browser-catch--> Running puppet---> scripts run as part of browser: not zombies:Malware run

Injecting spoofed objects such as scripts and web pages
Using Malware(read system counter when packet is accepted by server) to learn sequence number and then spoof packets.
